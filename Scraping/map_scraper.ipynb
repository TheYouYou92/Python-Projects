       "    'synopsis': 'Mindwash follows the story of Billy Seldom (Ben Edlin), a motivational speaker who is on the verge of becoming a household name with the slogan, \"Think for Yourself.\" He is about to reach a new pinnacle of success when the world suffers a catastrophic event. We follow him on a journey of self-destruction, including being on the verge of a cryptic demise of a co-dependent relationship with his longtime girlfriend Natalie (Camille Hyde), as he wrestles with the ever-changing landscape of media, fear, and influence. Billy tries to find his place in a world now spiraling out of control and exemplifying the lack of individual thinking. Billy must now ask himself if he really thinks for himself.',\n",

       "\"Misunderstood by his peers, rejected by the art establishment, wracked with grief over the loss of his older sister and tortured by addiction, the film captures Munch's life, painting an intimate and nuanced picture of a unique and multifaceted person and artist. This modern adaptation takes the viewers to four important chapters of his life: The story of Munch's first love, and the controversy around one of his early exhibitions in Berlin. This is followed by Munch's admission to a psychiatric clinic, where he was forced to make the biggest decision of his life. Finally, the film shows the artist's battle at the end of his life to save his works from the Nazis during World War II.—The Norwegian Film Institute\""
